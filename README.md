Text classification is a way for categorising any type of content into or out of a specified
category. Machine learning is used to classify text documents into a collection of pre-
determined classes. The classification is done based on selected documents and features
consisting in text documents. The classes are chosen prior to the experiment analysis,
and this is referred to as supervised machine learning approach. Organisations and en-
terprises use numerous text documents for industrial service and government records.
In text and archive associations, individual correspondence and records likewise existed.
Since there is a huge measure of text data that exists arbitrarily, text arrangement needs
are expanding. An AI strategy is expected to sort this information.
This research investigates an advanced text classification strategy that incorporates
stages such as a preprocessing approach that is fully centred on deleting stop-words and
stemming. In the text classification statistical analysis is used to give analytical and
comparative study for selecting features using Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes,
Decision Trees, logistic regression and KNN.
